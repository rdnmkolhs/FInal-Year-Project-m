# Face Recognition Attendance System
   A hybrid Desktop & Web application that uses Computer Vision to automate the attendance process.
   Instead of manual roll calls, this system detects faces via a webcam, recognizes registered students using the LBPH Algorithm, and automatically syncs the       attendance data to a Django + PostgreSQL backend server.


## Key Features
* Real-Time Face Recognition: Instantly identifies students via webcam.
#### Hybrid Architecture:
* Desktop App (Tkinter): For capturing images and marking attendance in the classroom.
* Web Dashboard (Django): For teachers/admins to manage students and view attendance reports.
* Database Integration: Uses PostgreSQL for secure and scalable data storage (replacing old CSV files).
* Multiple Attendance: Can detect and mark multiple students in a single session without duplication.
* Auto-Sync: New registrations and attendance logs are automatically sent from the Python app to the Server via API.


## Tech Stack
* Component	Technology
* Frontend (Desktop)	Python, Tkinter, Pillow
* Backend (Server)	Django (Python Framework)
* Database	PostgreSQL
* Computer Vision	OpenCV (cv2)
* Algorithm	LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)
* Communication	REST API (requests module)


## Project Structure
   * main.py: The Desktop Application (Camera & GUI).
   * Backend_Server/: The Django Project folder containing the API and Admin Panel.
   * TrainingImage/: Stores raw photos captured for training.
   * TrainingImageLabel/: Stores the trained model (Trainner.yml).
   * haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: Pre-trained model required for face detection.

## Installation & Setup
#### Clone the Repository
      git clone https://github.com/MagarPrashant0/Final-Year-Project.git
      cd Final-Year-Project
#### Install Python Dependencies
   You need libraries for both the Desktop App and the Django Server.
   pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy pandas Pillow requests django psycopg2-binary
   #### 3. Setup the Database (PostgreSQL)
      Install PostgreSQL and create a database named attendance_db.
      Update Backend_Server/settings.py with your database password.
#### Run the Backend Server
      Open a terminal in the Backend_Server folder:
      python manage.py makemigrations
      python manage.py migrate
      python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create your Admin login
      python manage.py runserver
      Keep this terminal running.
#### Run the Desktop App
      Open a new terminal in the main folder:
      python main.py

### How to Use
      Step 1: Register a New Student
      Enter ID and Name in the Tkinter App.
      Click "Take Images".
      The app captures 60-100 photos.
      It automatically sends the Student Details to the Django Database.
      Click "Save Profile".
      Enter the admin password to train the model.

#### Step 2: Mark Attendance
      Click "Take Attendance".
      The webcam opens. When a face is recognized:
      The Name is displayed on the screen.
      The status is updated from Absent to Present in the Database.
      Press 'q' or click the "X" to close.

#### Step 3: View Reports (Admin Panel)
      Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
      Login with your superuser credentials.
      View the list of Students and daily Attendance logs.


### How it Works (Logic Flow)
* Detection: OpenCV (Haar Cascade) finds a face in the video frame.
* Recognition: The LBPH algorithm compares the face against the trained Trainner.yml model.
#### API Call:
- If a match is found, Python sends the Student ID to the Django Server via HTTP POST.
- Django updates the PostgreSQL database.
- Django responds with the Student Name, which is then shown on the camera screen.


### Important Notes
* LBPH Algorithm: We use cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer because it is robust against lighting changes.
* PostgreSQL: Ensure the Postgres service is running before starting Django.
* Camera: If the camera doesn't open, ensure no other application (like Zoom) is using it.
